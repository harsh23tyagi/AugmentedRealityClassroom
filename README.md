# AugmentedRealityClassroom
Facebook Developers Hackathon-F8-hack

# Project Description:

- We used AR Studio to interact with Augmenting Reality objects in the real space and perform practical lab training over an AR model
- We used Internet of Things to create a publisher subscriber model to reflect the changes in the AR Model happening on teacher's end, to the student's app end.
- We even projected the AR model in unity for desktop based version
- We used REACT and node.js to create a responsive and interactive web portal, which aligned the teachers with the students.
- The backend handled the IoT requests too.
- We incorporated the Facebook messenger chatbox & Facebook page plug into the web portal to create a collaborative class forum and manage class events.

# Directory Structure:

The repo contains three sub-projects.
- The publisher mobile application- which is the teacher's end of controlling AR and giving a lecture + simulations (PROJECT_SUB)
- The subscriber mobile application - which is the student's end; listening to the lecture and watching the simulations with instructions (ProjectHack_PUB)
- The web portal - The whole backend and frontend of the web app handling the interaction between teachers and students and using facebook's messenger and event handling (WebPortal_Code)
